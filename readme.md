Custom IBID Plugins (IRC Bot Plugins)
====================

URL Process
---------------------
Processes any links posted through reddit, twitch, and youtube. Returns info about them if available.

Twitch Broadcaster
---------------------
Notifies a source/target (needs to be configured) with information about when a twitch broadcaster starts streaming or switches games. ibid-db --upgrade needs to create the database schema.



Plugins were written pretty quickly, if there's any improvements they will be appreciated.
