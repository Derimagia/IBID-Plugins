Custom IBID Plugins (IRC Bot Plugins)
====================

URL Process
---------------------
Processes any links posted through reddit, twitch, and youtube. Returns info about them if available.

Twitch Broadcaster
---------------------
Notifies a source/target (needs to be configured) with information about when a twitch broadcaster starts streaming or switches games. Twitch broadcasters currently need to be configured in the plugin file.




Plugins were written pretty quickly, if there's any improvements they will be appreciated.
